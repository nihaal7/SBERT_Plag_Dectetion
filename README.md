# Detecting machine-obfuscated content to bypass plagiarism detectors using Sentence BERT-based classifiers

Paraphrasing tools such as the SpinBot API pose a serious threat to academic integrity. It is extremely easy to copy an original paragraph and run it through a paraphrasing API to circumvent conventional plagiarism checkers. Methods have been explored to automatically classify machine-paraphrased content from human-generated content. These methods usually focus on using the entire paragraph to classify its originality. In this paper,
we demonstrate it is possible to classify the content using just the first few sentences of the paragraph using BERT-based sentence embeddings. Additionally, we also explore the performance of MPNET
sentence embeddings on this classification task.
